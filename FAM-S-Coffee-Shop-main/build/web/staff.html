            <div class="paragraphs_title">AGREEMENTS BETWEEN WORK’S COUNCIL AND BUSINESS OWNERS:</div>
            <div class="paragraphs_text">
                After hearing the complaints and suggestions of our employees through the work’s council, different agreements and updates have been made
                to the Workplace Health and Safety Plan to promote the proper development of our workers' activities. Among these agreements and modifications,
                we can highlight the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.boe.es/biblioteca_juridica/abrir_pdf.php?id=PUB-DT-2023-139">Agreement on working hours:</a> as it is saisd in the 4th
                        point of Article 34 of the Worker’s Statute, employees whose continuous daily working hours exceed 6 hours are entitled to a minimum break of
                        15 minutes, while employees under 18 years of age are entitled to a minimum break of 30 minutes. In addition to these breaks, employees will
                        have a certain flexibility, so that they can request a total of 2 breaks of 5 minutes each from a superior during the working day. This measure
                        has been implemented within our Workplace Health and Safety Plan with the aim of avoiding problems such as work-related stress, burnout, or anxiety,
                        among others.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Agreement on remuneration:</a> regarding overtime hours, an agreement
                        has been reached to improve salary compensation. As reflected in Article 46 of the fifth section of the Zaragoza Hostelry Agreement, employees
                        must receive an increase of no less than 75% of the regular hours for each worker. In our agreement, this percentage will be increased by 5% in
                        the case of structural or voluntary overtime hours. If they are considered as overtime hours due to major force, the increase will amount to 90%.
                        In all cases, our employees will have the right to receive the salary compensation within their payroll, as well as to accept an equivalent number
                        of compensatory rest hours instead, within a maximum period of 4 months as established by Royal Decree 2001/1983 of July 28 on the regulation of working
                        hours, special working hours and rest periods.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1997-8670">Agreement on training:</a> as stated in Article 3 of Royal Decree 487/1997, the employer
                        must adopt the technical or organizational measures necessary to avoid manual handling of loads, and in case this cannot be avoided, provide employees
                        with appropriate means to reduce risks. Following the latest update of our Workplace Health and Safety Plan, all our employees will receive ergonomics
                        training to prevent possible injuries caused by forced postures when handling furniture, carrying trays to serve tables, cleaning the establishment, or
                        performing some repetitive tasks. As well, Article 4 of the same decree states that the employer must ensure that workers and their representatives
                        receive adequate training and information on the risks associated with manual handling of loads, as well as on the prevention and protection measures
                        to be taken.</li>

            <div class="paragraphs_title">COLECTIVE AGREEMENT APPLIED AT FAM’S COFFEE SHOP:</div>
            <div class="paragraphs_text">
                In our company, we have decided to apply the <a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Zaragoza Hostelery Agreement</a> to
                our workers. This agreement establishes a series of rules and regulations that govern labor relations between employers and workers in the hostelry sector in
                Zaragoza. Some of the most important points of the agreement include:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Article 25 (work schedule):</a> establishes that the schedules will be
                        set by the company by mutual agreement with the worker’s representatives. In addition, the workers must be informed of their work shifts, working hours,
                        and rest days at least 7 days in advance.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Article 28 (Weekly rest):</a> all workers are entitled to enjoy 2 days of
                        rest per week, which must be within the same natural week. However, in companies with more than 50 workers, they may choose between two periods per year
                        with four consecutive days of rest on weekends, or four weekends of rest per year, with the company setting the dates and the day of the weekly closure
                        for rest. The company can only change the dates with the worker's consent, always giving seven day’s notice, and the altered rest must be moved to
                        another Sunday or holiday.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Article 32 (gender violence):</a> female workers who suffer from gender
                        violence have the right to reduce their working hours with a proportional reduction in salary or to reorganize their working hours through the
                        adaptation of schedules, flexible hours, or other forms of time organization used in the company to ensure their protection. If the worker is forced
                        to leave her job due to gender violence, she can suspend her employment contract.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ccoo-servicios.es/archivos/hosteleria-zaragoza-2022.pdf">Article 46 (overtime hours):</a> among other things, it highlights
                        that overtime hours must be paid with a minimum increase of at least 75% on the employee's ordinary salary.</li>
